# Atlantic and Gulf Coast Shark Incidents Visualization

## Project Description

This project analyzes shark incident data from the Global Shark Attack File, highlighting the distribution, frequency, and outcomes of shark encounters. The analysis aims to demystify perceptions about sharks by exploring trends, locations, and activities associated with incidents. The insights reveal that shark-related incidents are rare, and fatalities are even rarer, contributing to a more informed understanding of these marine creatures and their interactions with humans.

## Insights from the Analysis

### **1. Are Sharks Really Villains?**
- Out of 1,500 reported shark incidents, **96.5% were non-fatal**, showing that most shark encounters result in minor injuries, such as lacerations.
- Only **3.5%** of incidents resulted in fatalities, debunking the notion that sharks are frequent killers.

---

### **2. Incident Locations**
- Shark incidents are predominantly reported along the **Atlantic** and **Gulf Coast**, with **Florida** leading in the number of incidents.
- Floridaâ€™s tropical weather and water activities make it a hotspot for human-shark interactions.

---

### **3. Activities Leading to Incidents**
- **Surfing/Skiing:** The most common activity during shark encounters, responsible for **609 incidents**.
- **Swimming:** The second most common activity, accounting for **499 incidents**.
- **Fishing and Spearfishing:** Less common but still notable, with **150 and 85 incidents**, respectively.
- A small number of incidents occurred during unusual activities like taking selfies or teasing sharks.

---

### **4. Anatomy of Injuries**
- The **lower leg** is the most frequently injured body part in shark incidents, accounting for **649 cases**.
- Other commonly injured areas include the **arm (318 cases)** and **upper leg (227 cases)**.
- Interestingly, **154 cases** reported no injuries at all, showcasing how minor or avoidable many incidents are.

---

### **5. Historical Trends**
- Shark incidents have shown an upward trend, not due to increased shark aggression, but because of improved reporting mechanisms:
  - **Older reports** relied on newspapers, which limited data collection.
  - **Modern records** benefit from internet-based reporting, making it easier to track incidents.

---

### **6. Understanding Shark Behavior**
- Sharks are not inherently aggressive toward humans. Incidents often result from "taste testing," as sharks lack hands and rely on their mouths to explore potential food sources.
- Many incidents occur in deeper waters or during specific activities that inadvertently attract sharks.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Perception vs. Reality:** Sharks are not the villains they are often portrayed to be; most encounters end without severe outcomes.
- **Human-Shark Interactions:** Understanding patterns in shark behavior and human activity can reduce the risk of incidents.
- **Florida's Unique Role:** As the region with the highest number of incidents, Florida serves as a key area for understanding shark interactions.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive visualization of shark incidents, helping to shift the narrative from fear to understanding. By focusing on data-driven insights, the analysis offers a balanced view of shark encounters and encourages responsible and informed interactions with marine life.
